Input: [inputfile] [outputfile] [Any number of ascii characters] [Y values corresponding to each character***]

***No Y-Value can exceed 8190. Otherwise, it will be modded in the creation of the polynomial and it will become a smaller number. Larger Y-values can be used if a mersenne prime that is larger than any y-value is added to the mersenne prime array in the findMod method.
