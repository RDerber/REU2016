DNA Sequence Conversions
This project is intended to produce a benchmark suite of useful and common data transformations. It has branched out slightly 
to investigate different methods of transforming data. Included are some representative samples from the following fields of
interest: genomic sequencing, the internet of things, astronomical imaging, and data compression.
